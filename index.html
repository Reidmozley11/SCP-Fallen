        <h1>Installing Love 2d</h1>
        <p>In order to build this game you will first have to install: https://love2d.org/ (follow this link and download your choice of version for Love2D that is compatible for your computer). Launch the program and follow default installation procedures.</p>

        <h1>Running the Game</h1>
        <p>You will need to locate the cloned repo and simply drag the folder into the destination path of Love2D. This is most easily done by placing both files on the desktop and dragging the repo onto the Love2D icon.</p>
        <p>Or alternatively if you go to the Remedy Github you can download our zipped release! This will run the game ONLY ON WINDOWS, but will allow you to skip out on all of the intermediate download steps.</p>
